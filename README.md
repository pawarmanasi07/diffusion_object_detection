## Overview

This repository implements a novel object detection system that leverages diffusion processes and deep learning. The pipeline consists of five main stages: Input, Diffusion Process, Feature Extraction, Processing, and Detection.

## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Input Stage
* Takes input images in a standardized format
* Prepares images for the diffusion process

### 2. Diffusion Process
The diffusion stage consists of several key components:
* **Original Image**: Initial image input
* **Diffusion Steps**: Sequential application of diffusion transformations
* **Noisy Image t=T**: Final noisy image after diffusion process completion

### 3. Feature Extraction
This stage processes the diffused image through:
* **Timesteps t=0...T**: Multiple temporal sampling points
* **Multi-scale Feature Maps**: Extraction of features at various scales for comprehensive object detection

### 4. Processing
The processing stage includes:
* **UNet Layers**: Deep neural network architecture for feature processing
* **Aggregation Network**: Combines features from different scales
* **Feature Cube**: Consolidated feature representation

### 5. Detection
The final stage performs:
* **Object Detection Head**: Final layer responsible for object detection
* **Output**: Produces bounding boxes for detected objects
* **Training**: Includes original bounding boxes for training purposes

## Key Features
* Multi-scale feature extraction for robust object detection
* Integration of diffusion processes for enhanced feature learning
* UNet-based architecture for detailed feature processing
* Advanced aggregation network for feature combination
* End-to-end trainable pipeline

## Implementation Details

The pipeline implements a sophisticated object detection 
system that leverages diffusion processes to enhance feature extraction and object detection accuracy. 
The diffusion process creates a sequence of increasingly noisy versions of the input image, which are then processed 
through a feature extraction pipeline to generate rich, multi-scale feature representations.
